MLB Game Simulator
==============================

Simulate MLB matchup results

ICE PLOTS -> VISUALIZE HOW OUTPUT CHANGES WHEN INPUT DOES?

TODO:
- Develop each individual model:
    - Pitch generation
    - Pitch outcome
    - Bat outcome
    - Field outcome
- Need to select proper features, obtain likely models
- Once each model is working individually, start to connect
    - Get starting lineups, etc.
    - Can start simulating games based on the models
    - Run lots of simulations for games, generate box score
- Additional models will be needed for lineup swaps, pitcher swaps, etc.
    - Can start with first 5 inning picks...


- MlB analytics teams train pitchers where to throw based on batter weaknesses
- Will need to adjust for this
- up and comers are receptive, older players are not
