    "# Generate Field Outcome\n",
    " - Given the batter has made contact, and the hit characteristics are given, what happens on the field?\n",
    " - Is the ball caught, do runners advance, is it a home run?\n",
    " - Model must factor in current game state, i.e., bases, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Difficulties:\n",
    " - Maybe need to adjust for outfielders?\n",
    " - How to factor stealing in, this also needs to be worked on in the bat outcome as it can happen on strikes/balls?"
